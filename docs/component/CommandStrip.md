## Components - command strips

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirill-grouchnikov/ephemeral/breeze/docs/images/component/walkthrough/intro-text-styling-bold-italic.png" width="646" border=0/>

Command strip is a logically and visually connected group of commands (and their projections). In the screenshot above the four styling commands - bold, italic, underline, strikethrough - are grouped together to reinforce the logical connection of the underlying functionality.

### Models

`CommandGroup` is the content model, and `CommandStripPresentationModel` is the presentation model for command button strips.

The `orientation` attribute can be used to specify whether the strip buttons should be laid out horizontally or vertically.

The `commandPresentationState` attribute determines the visual presentation of the strip commands in the projected buttons.

The `horizontalGapScaleFactor` and `verticalGapScaleFactor` can be used to control the space around the icons of the projected buttons.

The `backgroundAppearanceStrategy` attribute controls the background appearance of the projected buttons.

### Projection

`CommandButtonStripProjection` is the projection that combines `CommandGroup` content model and `CommandStripPresentationModel` presentation model. The result of its `project` function is a command button strip composable.

### Sample code

First we create four toggle commands:

```kotlin
// Bold style command
val commandBold = Command(
    text = "Bold",
    icon = format_text_bold(),
    isActionToggle = true,
    isActionToggleSelected = bold,
    onTriggerActionToggleSelectedChange = { bold = it }
)

// Italic style command
val commandItalic = Command(
    text = "Italic",
    icon = format_text_italic(),
    isActionToggle = true,
    isActionToggleSelected = italic,
    onTriggerActionToggleSelectedChange = { italic = it }
)

// Underline style command
val commandUnderline = Command(
    text = "Underline",
    icon = format_text_underline(),
    isActionToggle = true,
    isActionToggleSelected = underline,
    onTriggerActionToggleSelectedChange = { underline = it }
)

// Strikethrough style command
val commandStrikethrough = Command(
    text = "Strikethrough",
    icon = format_text_strikethrough(),
    isActionToggle = true,
    isActionToggleSelected = strikethrough,
    onTriggerActionToggleSelectedChange = { strikethrough = it }
)
```

And then we create a `CommandGroup` content model and a `CommandStripPresentationModel` presentation model, combine them together into a `CommandButtonStripProjection` and then call `project()` to get a composable that is added to the component hierarchy of our application:

```kotlin
CommandButtonStripProjection(
    contentModel = CommandGroup(
        commands = listOf(
            commandBold,
            commandItalic,
            commandUnderline,
            commandStrikethrough
        )
    ),
    presentationModel = CommandStripPresentationModel(
        orientation = StripOrientation.Vertical,
        commandPresentationState = CommandButtonPresentationState.Small,
        horizontalGapScaleFactor = 0.75f
    )
).project()
```
